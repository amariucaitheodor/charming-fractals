An interesting case is when we intentionally make the colouring inaccurate by setting closeRoot to 1. When this happens, some complex numbers that converge to a complex root (located in the upper and lower quadrants) are actually 'mistaken' by our algorithm with numbers that converge to a real root (blue and red). However, we profit off of this inaccuracy by getting a pretty picture.
